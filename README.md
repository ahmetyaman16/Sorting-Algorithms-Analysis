# Sorting Algorithms Analysis

This educational project analyzes and compares the performance of various sorting algorithms under different scenarios (best, average, and worst cases). It also provides visualizations and metrics to help understand the theoretical vs. exact behavior of each algorithm.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project includes implementations and performance comparisons of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Each algorithm is evaluated based on:
- **Best Case**
- **Average Case**
- **Worst Case**

We compare both **exact comparisons** and **asymptotic time complexity**.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

The project generates:
- Time complexity graphs (Exact vs. Asymptotic)
- Ratio plots to verify theoretical consistency
- Tables for direct comparison of complexity metrics

All graphs are created using `matplotlib` and exported in high-resolution formats
